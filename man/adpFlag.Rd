\details{
adpFlag function
flag an adp object based on a series of parameters including percent good, and error velocity.

This function also defaults to flagging depth values based on the Teledyne RDI standard

Rmax = Dcosx

where Rmax is the maximum acceptable distance range from the ADCP, D is total depth and x is the beam angle of the ADCP.
